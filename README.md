# Flow Network Analysis Tool

## Inputs to reach each point in the program:

### 3.i Global number of airports and number of available flights

-> Consult Flight Statistics, Global Statistics

### 3.ii Number of flights out of an airport; and from how many different airlines

-> Consult Flight Statistics, Option E

### 3.viii Identify the top-k airport with the greatest air traffic capacity, that is, with the greatest number of flights

-> Consult Flight Statistics, Airport Statistics, Option C

### 3.ix Identify the airports that are essential to the networkâ€™s circulation capability (airports are essential if, when removed, areas of the network start to be unreachable)

-> Consult Flight Statistics, Airport Statistics, Option D

### 4. Present the best flight option

->  Plan a Trip , choose the next option accordingly

### 5. Search for the best flight option with filters

## Post Scriptum:
If you are having troubles with running the project:
1. Make a copy of the dataset folder inside the cmake-build-debug
2. Delete cmake-build-debug
3. Run the program and when prompted with the running error, select the option : "Reload cmake project"
4. Put the folder copy inside the new cmake-build-debug
5. Have fun using the program

Also important, if you have the problem of not loading the csv files, be sure that they are in a folder named dataset inside the cmake-build-debug. Furthermore, the names of the datasets were altered 
for simplification issues. If you have any problem while loading the CSVs please use the following names: 
1. LargeDataSet/Cities.csv 
; LargeDataSet/Pipes.csv
; LargeDataSet/Reservoir.csv
; LargeDataSet/Stations.csv
<br>
2. LargeDataSet/Cities.csv
; SmallDataSet/Pipes.csv
; SmallDataSet/Reservoir.csv
; SmallDataSet/Stations.csv
